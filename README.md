# [Web-dev wiki](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki)

You won't find any code lines in this project.

I use this repository to store all my knowlage under the [Wiki tab](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki). From there I use the **Search** from the sidebar navigation to find content.

I document answers that I found to technical issues that I faced while coding or designing stuff for my full time [day job](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martindubenet/). From the tiny [SSH Key setting](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki/setup-%E2%80%A2-SSH-key) that I keep on forgetting, to my [Visual Studio Code app preferences](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki/app-%E2%80%A2-Visual-Studio-Code) that I can't live without.

### Most useful documents

From all my wiki pages, here's a list of my most used ones:

[Characters cheatsheet](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki/Characters-cheatsheet-–-HTML-vs-HEX-vs-Glyphicons-–-En-Fr-lexicon) is a lexicon of HTML characters, including some latin characters commonly used in French. Each characters is described in both English and French and some have a link to their _FontAwesome_ equivalence.

My plain list of [Bootstrap (4.4) utility classes for Atomic CSS](https://github.com/martindubenet/wed-dev/wiki/css-%E2%80%A2-Bootstrap) allows me to quickly find the classes I need.

… So far, as of january 2020, I have 39 pages in my wiki and I keep adding as I learn new stuff.
