### Design wording

* **Atomic CSS** is a method of coding CSS that uses multiple inline generic CSS class as values to render the element within an HTML `style` attribute. This method offers a fast integration time and the best page download performance at the cost of maintenance since each element needs to be edited one-by-one when change requests comes in.

* **Atomic Design** consist of (1) _Atoms_, (2) _Molecules_, (3) _Organisms_, (4) _Templates_ and (5) _Pages_ concurrently working together to create effective interface design systems. â€ Atomic design is not a linear process, but rather a mental model to help us think of our UIs (_User Interfaces_) as both a cohesive whole and a collection of parts at the same time.

* **Data Visualization** discipline involves designing (static) **infographics** or **interactive charts** out of analysis by [data-driven journalisme (_DDJ_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism) to emphasis on details that humans canâ€™t see without filtering out a large volume of data. 

* **Design Sprint**â€  is a creative methodology inspired by the _Agile Scrum_ approach of breaking down big stories as small doable tasks where is _Design Sprint_ is oriented toward isolating the fondamental problem to solve using ideas that are developped and prototyped as a team within a limited time frame (usually five days).

* **Design System**â€  is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

* **JavaScript** is a (the only) scripted language that can be executed on a userâ€™s device. It is universally supported by all browsers on any devices, from computers to mobile phones. JavaScript evolved as frameworks (NodeJS/npm, Angular, React, VueJS, etcâ€¦) on which the modern (mobile and web) applications are executed. _TypeScript is a superset of the JavaScript language._

* **Pattern Library** (and/or Style Guide) is a collection of the assets and components you use to build a digital product.

* **Slot** is a window within a content that contains or includes a duplicated part of content or code (known as _partials_ in .NET, modules, widgets or _content fragment_).

* **Template** is a reusable page layout. A matrix for an internet layout. Not to be confused with the [&lt;template&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) HTML tag.

* **UI** is the accronyme of Â«_**User Interface**_Â» which is the graphical aspect of a digital product.

* **UX** is the accronyme of Â«_**User Experience**_Â» which is the global aspect that the end client perceive when using a (digital, virtual or real) product. This discipline encompasses the _UI_. It is the equivalence of [_Customer Experience_ (CX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience) but for the internet context.

* **MVC**â€  is the accronyme of Â«_**Modal Viewer Controller**_Â». This model or "pattern" is commonly used by developers for coding modern user interfaces. It provides the fundamental pieces for designing a program and/or a web application using object-oriented programming, since the different models, views, and controllers can be treated as objects and reused within an application. 
_MVC_ was first described way back in 1979, before the "www" era when there was no concept of web applications. The architecture used today for web applications is an adaptation of the original pattern.


### Roles

* **Designer** is a creative role mastering visual communications to better render contents to users. With the ability to capture and digest peopleâ€™s desires and style trends, they tends to be sociable individuals.

   * **UX designer** is an ergonomic and/or cognitive science specialist that layouts how a user is expected to navigate witnin an entire web site or application. After validating with front-end dev team lead they usually render grayed out mockups with specifications and requirements for developpers. They tends to be rational cartesian minded designers.
   * **UI designer** is a graphic designer for the web. They know design trends and use them to render layouts that are pleasent for the users. They create moodboards, icons, SVG images, decide the proper fonts and apply color themes and graphical styles to images.
   * **Animation designer**, or **Motion designer**, is a niche that sites between UX and UI. They used to be about [Flash ActionScript](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) specialists but since mobiles devices killed that technologie their expertise evolved to ecmascript (JavaScript) for rendering animated SVG images accross all devices and browsers

* **Developer** (_web developer_) is mastering scripted languages for developping coded solutions and managing datas issues. All developperâ€™s scripts are subject to unitary testing for solution stability. Algorithms been the backbone of all scripts, _web developers_ tends to be cartesian minded people.

   * **Back-end developer** masters scripting languages for/from database that gets **executed on a server** (_back-end_). Languages like .Net, Java, PHP, Python or Perl among others.
   * **Front-end developer** is above all a Â«_developper_Â». As so he also masters scripting languages but the ones that **rendered by the servers** (_front-end_), frameworks like among others NodeJS/npm, Angular, React or VueJS, that executes on the users devices.

* **Information Architect (_AI_)** analytic individues that first digest ownerâ€™s (customers and/or product owners) needs then goes trough all contents to regroup them. From there they validate the value of those contents with **metricsðŸ“Š** from Search Engin Specialists [(_SEO_) specialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) and _UX Designers_. Usually, if the owner has not done it yet, they define **user personas** that helps the design team and copywriter to visualize their customers and their needs.

* **Integrator** (_web integrator_) are translating UI mockups in HTML markup for the web browsers. They are W3C accessibility ([_WCAG_](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)) and organic SEO specialist. They master HTML, CSS/Sass for responsive layout accros different devices screens, SVG image coding, and use JavaScript for UI (jQuery) but rely on a Front-end devs to set-up JavaScript frameworks for them to use in a solution. Their JavaScript lines do NOT pass by unitary testing as long as it does not put the solution stability on jeopardy.
